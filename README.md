# Local Web Server
Designed for the house that I reside in with numerous others, I decided to organize cool features for everyone to use at once.

After logging, the user is presented with the calendar page to view upcomming events or tasks / homework. You can also determine who made the task and how frequent the task will be presented (email alerts coming soon).

Next we have a voting system for surveys which once again displays the owner and the current progress of the vote. Once you vote, you can't retract.

Users can also share files through an upload system limited to I believe 1 gb per file and of course the storage available on the server computer. Users can create folders, rename folders and file size and type will be displayed.

Of course, a house driven website wouldn't be complete without a message service. Users can select whom they wish to message from the dropdown list. Once messages are sent to another user, a window will appear indefinitely of the history.

If you're too lazy to leave your room and you want to know who's around, what better way than to scan the local network for IP addresses and determine who's connected by Mac address.

Finally, there's a music voting service for house parties using Spotify. Details about a specific playlist will be shown. As anyone can access just this page, you can vote for the next played song from the dropdown list. Once the current song finishes, a winner of all the votes will be determined and the song with the most votes will win and therefore be played next.
